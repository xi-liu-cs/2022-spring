no input: same result 
no output: what is purpose of it running?

single CPU attached to the main memory
of the system via some kind of memory bus

general I/O bus
peripheral component interconnet (PCI 外设组件互连标准)
graphics and other higher-performance I/O

lower down: peripheral bus
small computer system interface (SCSI 小型计算机系统接口)
Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA 串口硬盘) 
universal serial bus (USB, 通用串行总线)
these connect slow devices to system

why need a HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE?
physics & cost

where components that demand high
performance (such as the graphics card) 
are nearer the CPU




3
PCI (peripheral component interconnect
外设部件互连标准)
PCI插槽也是主板带有最多数量的插槽类型
hardware must also present some
kind of interface that allows the system
software to control its operation
firmware(固件permanent software 
programmed into a read-only memory)



4
3 registers: status, command, data
polling 轮询 the device (basically, just asking it what is going on)
writes transfer disk block (4 KB) to the device
polling = inefficient
wastes cpu time to wait for
slow device to complete its activity



5
interrupt 中断
instead of polling device repeatedly
os can issue a request
put the calling process to sleep,
and context switch to another task

Without interrupts, the system simply spins, polling
the status of the device repeatedly until the I/O is complete


7
direct memory access DMA
OS would program the DMA engine by telling
it where the data lives in memory,
how much data to copy, and which device to send it to
