therac-25

wiki
Because of concurrent programming errors
(also known as race conditions),
it sometimes gave its patients radiation 
doses that were hundreds of times greater 
than normal, resulting in death or serious injury

6 known accidents involved massive overdoses
by Threrac-25

Many companies building safety-critical software
are not using proper procedures from 
a software-engineering and safety-engineering perspective

attribute a single cause to an 
accident is usually a serious mistake

The Therac-25 accidents are the most 
serious computer-related accidents to 
date (at least nonmilitary)

genesis
Medical linear accelerators (linacs) 
accelerate electrons to create high energy
beams that can destroy tumors 
with minimal impact on the surrounding 
healthy tissue

shallow tissue : treated with accelerated electrons 电子
deeper tissue : the electron beam 波束
is converted into X-ray photons 光子

Atomic Energy of Canada Limited
produced 
1. the Therac-6, a 6 million (10^6) electron volt (MeV) accelerator 
capable of producing X rays only
2. the Therac-20. a 20-MeV dual mode (X rays or electrons) accelerator

AECL developed "double pass"
A douhle-pass accelerator needs 
much less space to develop comparable 
energy levels

more economic:
use magnetron(磁控管 high-power vacuum tube
that generates microwaves using the 
interaction of a stream of electrons with
a magnetic field) rather than klystron
(速调管 linear-beam vacuum tube)

higher energy, depth dose



3
as energy increases, the depth in the 
body at which maximum dose buildup 
occurs also increases, sparing tissue above target area

only 1 machine required
for both treatment modalities 模式
(electrons and photons)

programmed data processor (PDP)

therac-25 has more responsiblity for maintaining safety

therac-20 has independent protective circuits for 
monitoring electron-beam scanning

hardware interlocks and backups 
interlock
(= a device or mechanism for connecting 
or coordinating the function of different components)
are not worth the expense

therac-25 software developed by single person
using assembly

lack of documentation on 
software specifications and a software test plan

beam on in response to operator command
beam off when treatment is completed

therac-25 has a stand-alone
real-time treatment os

software in assembly
has 
1. stored data
2. scheduler
3. set of critical & noncritical tasks
4. interrupt services

assumptions
1. errors reduced by testing on hardware simulator
2. program software does not degrade due to wear, 
fatigue, reproduction process
3. execution errors caused by faulty hardware components
soft errors induced by alpha particles & electromagnetic noise

hardware failure
OR gate leading to event of getting wrong energy:
probability of 10^-11

massive overdoses

extensive design changes, including 
hardware safeguards against software errors

details of accident are sketchy

after lumpectomy (肿块切除术) to remove
malignant breast tumor,

scheduler controis the sequences of all noninterrupt 
events and coordinates all concurrent processes

software allows concurrent access to shared 
memory, that there is no real synchronization aside from 
data stored in shared variables

"test" and "set" 
for such variables are not indivisible operations. 
Race conditions resulting from this implementation of multitasking 
played an important part in the accidents.

When the machine 
turned on. she felt a " tremendous force 
of heat ... this red-hot sensation."

patient went home,
developed a reddening and swelling
in center of the treatment area
shoulder froze

Doses of 1000 
rads can be fatal if delivered to the 
whole body

rad = (radiation absorbed dose 辐射吸收剂量) 
cause death in 50 percent
of the cases is 500 rads

the patient's breast had 
to be removed because of the radiation 
burns. She completely lost the use of 
her shoulder and her arm, and was in 
constant pain

operators of the machine refused 
to believe that it could have been caused 
by the Therac-25

Again, the machine shut down 
in the same manner. 
The operator repeated this process 
four times after the 
original attempt - the display showing 
"no dose" delivered to the patient each 
time. 

complained of burning,
hip pain, and excessive swelling
in the region of treatment

autopsy revealed the cause of death as 
the cancer

if not died, a total hip replace ment would 
have been necessary as a result of the 
radiation overexposure

operators complained 
that it took too long to enter the treatment plan

operators use carriage return 
to copy treatment site data

series of carriage returns would complete data entry

2 ways shut down:
1. treatment suspend, 
which required a complete machine reset to restart
2. treatment pause,
single-key command to restart machine

The operator's manual supplied with the machine does 
not explain nor even address the malfunction codes.

no indication that these malfunctions could place a 
patient at risk

This software package does not 
appear to contain a safety system 

she had been taught that there were "so many 
safety mechanisms" that she understood it was virtually 
impossible to overdose a patient

The problem was exacerbated by the 
design of the mechanism

turntable 转盘 is a rotating table
therapeutic modes: electron mode and photon 
mode
3rd position: no beam at all
correct positioning of the patient

turntable position is monitored by three microswitches 微型开关
corresponding to the three cardinal turntable positions

position of turntable, sent to computer as 
a 3-bit binary signal

raw, highly concentrated accelerator is 
dangerous to living tissue

software checks were substituted for 
many traditional hardware interlocks.

turntable position tolerated a 1 bit error

"analysis of the hazard rate of the new solution 
indicates an improvement over the old

testing of the microswitch was "inconclusive."

data-entry speed during editing was the key factor in producing the 
error condition
if prescription data was edited at a fast pace,
the overdose occurred

It took some practice before the physicist could repeat the procedure rapidly 
enough to elicit the Malfunction 54 message at will

he determined that the dose was 
somewhere over 4,000 rads

AECL said they had measured 
the dosage (at the center of the field) to 
be 25,000 rads


12
frying sound heard by 
the patient was the ion chambers being 
saturated

focusing on particular software bugs is 
not the way to make a safe system

virtually all complex software can be made 
to behave in an unexpected 
fashion under certain conditions

particular coding error
is not as important as general unsafe design of software overall

treatment monitor task (Treat) 
controls the various phases of treatment by 
executing its eight subroutines

One of Treat's subroutines, called 
Datent (data entry), communicates with 
the keyboard handler task (a task that 
runs concurrently with Treat) via a 
shared variable (data-entry completion flag)

datent subroutine detects the 
variable's change in status
and changes the value of Tphase



19
When software was involved, AECL made no assessment 
of the "how and why" of software faults 
and took any combination of software faults as a single event

AND/OR tree format, 
using a basic understanding
of the machine operation to determine the causes


21
medical accelerator "industry" has become perhaps 
a little complacent about safety

Accidents usually involve 
a complex web of 
interacting events with 
multiple contributing 
factors.

mistake
= tendency to believe that 
the cause of an accident 
had been determined
 (for example, a microswitch failure in the Hamilton accident)
without adequate evidence to
 come to this conclusion and 
without looking at all possible contributing factors

virtually all factors involved in accidents can 
be labeled human error

It is nearly as useless to ascribe the 
cause of an accident to a computer error 
or a software error



contributing factors:
• management inadequacies and lack 
of procedures for following through on 
all reported incidents. 
• ovcrconfidence in the software and 
removal of hardware interlocks (making the software into a single point of 
failure that could lead to an accident). 
• presumably less-than-acceptable 
software-engineering practices, and 
• unrealistic risk assessments along 
with overconfidence in the results of 
these assessments.


software will 
not or cannot fail: this attitude leads to 
complacency and overreliance on computerized functions




22
When prohlemsstarted occurring, 
investigators assumed that hardware was 
the cause and focused only on the hardware. 

In the Hamilton accident, a transient microswitch failure was assumed 
to be the cause


The Therac-25 software "lied" 
to the operators. and the machine itself 
could not detect that a massive overdose had occurred

engineers need to design for worst case
