how to find data needed on disk?
sys has metadata

directories
give a way to organize

attach human friendly name to files

go from human friendly name to a number
that represent metadata of a file

fixed location of directory on sys



approach 1: single dir for whole sys

map: <name, inumber>

mike - todo.txt, 64  //look at 64th inode or data block
pat - todo.txt, 121



approach 2: single dir for each user
/mike
/pat
/jo

map name to number





approach 3: hierarchical name space
directory map from names to files OR directories 



naming


www.cs.nyu.edu.
. -> edu. -> nyu.edu.

hierarchical name - scalability

large name spaces tend to be hierarchical
cloud computing infastratures has changed

domain name system 域名系统


directory is a special kind of file
struct dirent

/ root
. current dir
.. parent dir



create another name for that file
ln = link

to create a hardlink
add an entry
<essay.txt, 7>
<hello.txt, 7>


link count:
number of link

hard: 
$ln x y

remove file
unlink()
lower link count


soft:
$ln -s x y
create new inode, new file named "y",
its contents are "x"



ffs
fast file system

cluster files in same dir
- make data blocks bigger (4, 8, 16 KB)
- free block: store separately (bitmap)



cylinder group
all data equidistant
only paying rotational delay

not move disk head to seek
