concurrency 并发性

abstraction of address space 地址空间
enable program to behave as if it has its own memory

THREAD 线程 是操作系统能够进行运算调度的最小单位. 它被包含
在进程之中, 是进程中的实际运作单位
thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
instructions that can be managed indep by a scheduler调度

multi-threaded program : more than 1 point of execution

each thread is like a separate process
but threads share the same address space of thus can 
access the same data
每个线程类似于独立的进程, 但线程共享地址空间,
从而能访问相同的数据

context switch we perform between threads
as compared to processes:
address space remains the same


2
address space of a classic process (single-threaded process)
has only 1 stack;
multi-threaded process, each thread runs 
independently: 1 stack per thread
 
any stack-allocated variables, parameters,
return values, and other things
that we put on the stack will be placed
in thread-local storage



3
parallelism:
add two large arrays
(using processors to each perform a portion of the work)

could use multiple processes instead of threads
but threads share address space 
easy to share data
