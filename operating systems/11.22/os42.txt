file sys data structure must persist, survive
how to update persistent data struct despite 
presence of power loss or system crash
what happens if someone trips over power cord
and machine loses power

崩溃一致性问题 crash-consistency problem:
need to update 2 on-disk structures, A and B
disk only service 1 request at a time
1 of the 2 requests will reach disk first (either A or B)
if system crashes or loses power
after 1 write completes,
on-disk struct will be left in an inconsistent state
(if system crash or lose power
between any 2 writes,
on-disk state may only partially get updated)

old approach: fsck 文件系统检查程序, (file system checker)
journaling日志记录
write-ahead logging预写日志

3
when append (add a new data block), 
must update 3 on-disk structures:
1. inode, must point to new block, record larger size 
2. new data block
3. new version of data bitmap
