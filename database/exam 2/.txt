is there a mistake in the question: "How many stages must the aggregate( ) function include in the "aggregation pipeline"?"
the closest answer seems to be "as many as desired"
but the mongodb manual says 1000 is the upper limit
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits/
"Number of Stages Restrictions
Changed in version 5.0: MongoDB 5.0 limits the number of aggregation pipeline stages allowed in a single pipeline to 1000."
what should i do?

https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/createcollection-method-mongodb
Collections in MongoDB can be created implicitly while we are importing the data or explicitly by specifying the ‘createCollection’ command
collection is created automatically when data is imported from the application

for the question that asks me "What is the average increase per year in the total number of pigs in the United States between 2009 and 2019?"
should i find "(sum_{i = 2009}^{2019} pig_count_at_year_i - pig_count_at_year_{i - 1}) / (2019 - 2009)"?

in the data source and definitions, for format YxxxxF, it says "actual counts have no value in this field",
then what does the cell value "A" represent in column YxxxxF?

6. How many entries for United States have actual counts of items for the year 2019?
us_data = df[df["Area"] == "United States of America"]
num_entries = 0 # number of entries having actual counts of items 
for i in range(us_data.shape[0]): # shape[0] = number of rows
    if us_data.iloc[i]["Y2019"] == "" or pd.isnull(us_data.iloc[i]["Y2019"]):
        num_entries += 1
num_entries
