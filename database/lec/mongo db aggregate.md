## Saving the data file to a web server

If you typically connect to the MongoDB database server from a web server, such as **i6** , it's easy to upload the data file to the web server using a Secure File Transfer (SFTP) application like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).

![Cyberduck login](../files/mongodb/cyberduck.png)

---

template: data-set

## Setting up the environment on the i6 web server

On **i6**, to import the data file into a MongoDB databae collection, first go to the UNIX/Linux command line from where you typically connect to a MongoDB database, navigate to whichever folder you saved the data file into, and issue the following commands to set up the environment:

```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
module load mongodb-3.2.0
```

- If you have already entered these commands into your account's `.bashrc` settings file, then you do not need to re-enter them from the command line.

---

template: data-set

## Import the data into MongoDB

Import the CSV data file into a MongoDB collection named `jobs`:

```bash
mongoimport --headerline --type=csv --host=database_host --db=your_database_name --collection=jobs --file=./NYC_jobs.csv --username=your_username --password=your_password
```

--

- this assumes the `NYC_Jobs.csv` file is located within the current working directory.

--

- replace `database_host`, `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with the correct credentials.

--

- if you are running a local MongoDB sever on your own machine, you can remove the `--db=your_database_name` part of the command.

---

name: sanity-check

# Basics

--

## Connect to the database

Before going into aggregation, let's check basic queries on the database to ensure they produce the expected results.

--

```bash
mongo your_database_name --host database_host -u your_username -p
```

- replace `your_database_name`, `database_host`, and `your_username` with the correct credentials.

--

- you will be asked to supply your MongoDB password... enter it when asked.

--

- if running a MongoDB server locally on your own machine, you do not need to supply these credentials.

---

template: sanity-check

## View a list of collections

Let's verify that a `jobs` collection has indeed been created in the database.

--

- select the correct database on this database server where `your_database_name` is replaced with the correct database name:

```mongodb
use your_database_name
```

--

- show a list of all the collections within the selected database:

```mongodb
show collections
```

--

- you should see the `jobs` collection listed.

---

template: sanity-check

## Retrieve and counting documents

Let's try a few simple retrievals of documents from the `jobs` collection.

--

- Retrieve just one document:

```javascript
db.jobs.findOne();
```

--

Retrieve `10` documents:

```javascript
db.jobs.find().limit(10);
```

--

Retrieve all documents:

```javascript
db.jobs.find();
```

--

Count documents in the result set:

```javascript
db.jobs.find().count();
```

---

template: sanity-check

## Find distinct values

The `db.collection.distinct()` function allows us to retrieve distinct values for a given field.

--

- find the distinct values in the `Agency` field:

```javascript
db.jobs.distinct("Agency");
```

--

- find the distinct values in the `Full-Time/Part-Time indicator` field:

```javascript
db.jobs.distinct("Full-Time/Part-Time indicator");
```

---

template: sanity-check

## Sorting results

The `db.collection.find().sort()` function sorts results. For example, sort all documents by the `Job ID` field, and show just the top `3` results, and show the documents in a pretty format.

```javascript
db.jobs.find().sort({ "Job ID": 1 }).limit(3).pretty();
```

--

- same as above, but only retrieve the `Job ID`, `Agency`, and `Business Title` fields:

```javascript
let fields = { _id: 0, "Job ID": 1, Agency: 1, "Business Title": 1 };
db.jobs.find({}, fields).sort({ "Job ID": 1 }).limit(3).pretty();
```

--

- same as above, but only retrieve documents that have `POLICE DEPARTMENT` in the `Agency` field, with no limit.

```javascript
let filter = { Agency: "POLICE DEPARTMENT" };
db.jobs.find(filter, fields).sort({ "Job ID": 1 }).pretty();
```

---

template: sanity-check

## Sorting results (continued)

Let's put our database skills to good use and find the `20` top-paying jobs in city government:

--

```javascript
let fields = {
  _id: 0,
  "Job ID": 1,
  "Business Title": 1,
  "Posting Date": 1,
  "Salary Range To": 1,
};

let orderBy = { "Salary Range To": -1 };
db.jobs.find({}, fields).sort(orderBy).limit(20).pretty();
```

--

- we have used a **projection** to limit the retrieved fields to the `Job ID`, `Business Title`, `Posting Data`, and `Salary Range To`.

# Aggregation

--

## Concept

As with relational SQL databases, MongoDB supports aggregate functions and grouping of data. There are a few ways to do this in MongoDB.

--

- Aggregation pipeline

--

- Single purpose aggregation operations

--

- Map-reduce

--

We will focus on the **aggregation pipeline** technique.

---

template: aggregation

## Aggregation pipeline

The aggregation pipeline is a multi-stage process that transforms documents into an aggregated result.

--

- the stages and order of execution are determined by the user

--

- the output from one stage becomes the input for the next stage

--

To start an aggregation, we call the `aggregate()` function on a collection:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate();
```

---

Into the `db.collection.aggregate()` function, we pass in an array containing a sequence of aggregation pipeline stages. These stages could include:

--

- `$match` - to filter documents by criteria

--

- `$count` - to count the number documents at this stage

--

- `$project` - to calculate or select particular fields

--

- `$group` - to group documents by a common attribute

--

These pipeline **stages** have counterparts in the simple MongoDB `db.collection.find()` function queries - the criteria argument, `count()` function, the projection, and so on.

--

- Using these special aggregation pipeline stage operators, instead of the regular features of a `find()` function call, allows them to be piped or chained together, so that the input of one becomes the output of another.

---

## Aggregation pipeline (continued again)

There are more aggregation pipeline stage operators, although these are less often used.

--

- `$addFields` (similar to $project)

--

- `$bucket` - binning values

--

- `$sample` - to select a random number of documents from its input

--

- `$sort` - to sort results within a pipeline

--

- `$limit` - to limit results within a pipeline

--

A full list of aggregation pipeline operators is available in [the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/).

## "$fieldName" Syntax

You'll often see syntax that looks like `"$fieldName"` - a field name prefixed with dollar, and quoted as a string.

--

These dollar filed names represent the value at that `fieldName`.

--

- this syntax differentiates this from a hardcoded value.

--

- for example `{fieldName: "foo"}` is different from `{fieldName: "$foo"}`

--

- the first sets the value to exactly `"foo"`, but the second sets the value to whatever is contained in the field named `foo`

---

template: aggregation

## $match

The `$match` operator filters documents in the pipeline. Here is the operator unattached to any particular pipeline.

```javascript
{
  $match: {
    city: "Brooklyn";
  }
}
```

--

- the value to assign the `$match` field is a query object, like in regular `find()` queries.

---

template: aggregation

## $count

As the name implies, `$count` counts the number of documents incoming from the previous stage.

```javascript
{
  $count: "countPolicyAnalysts";
}
```

--

For example, if the `$match` and `$count` operators were placed within a pipeline, it might look like:

```javascript
db.jobs.aggregate([
  { $match: { "Business Title": "Policy Analyst" } },
  { $count: "countPolicyAnalysts" },
]);
```

---

template: aggregation

## $project

The `$project` stage can modify the shape of a document by adding, suppressing and calculating fields.

--

- think of this as the `SELECT` list in SQL (where you can choose columns, create calculated columns, etc.)

--

- the value is a document that contains specifications for the transformations to be applied. It can contain:

--

    - `fieldName` or `_id` as `1`, `true`, `0`, `false` for inclusion and suppression
    - `fieldName` as an expression

--

For example,

```javascript
let fields = { _id: 0, "Job ID": 1, "Business Title": 1 };
db.jobs.aggregate([{ $project: fields }]);
```

---

template: aggregation

## $project (continued)

For example, uppercasing a field called business title →

```javascript
let projection = {
  _id: 0,
  "Job ID": 1,
  title: { $toUpper: "$Business Title" },
};
db.jobs.aggregate([{ $project: projection }]);
```

---

template: aggregation

## $project (continued again)

For example, combining `$match` and `$project` to show jobs that have "External" Posting Type with a subset of fields.

--

First, a projection for only the fields `Job ID`, `Posting Type` as `ptype`, and an uppercased `Business Title` as `title`:

```javascript
var projection = {
  _id: 0,
  "Job ID": 1,
  ptype: "$Posting Type",
  title: { $toUpper: "$Business Title" },
};
```

--

Pipe the external job postings to this projection:

```javascript
db.jobs.aggregate([
  { $match: { "Posting Type": "External" } },
  { $project: projection },
]);
```

---

template: aggregation

## More operators

Because a projection can result in calculated fields, there are a [large number of aggregation pipeline operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/) for manipulating strings, dates, performing simple arithmetic, etc.

--

Some examples:

--

- `$convert` to convert from one type to another: {$convert: {input: "$fieldName", to: "int"}}

--

- `$split` to break up a string into an array of substrings using some delimiter: {$split: ["$fieldName", ","]}

--

- `$substrCP` to extract a substring from another string by code point: {$substrCP: ["$fieldName", 0, 4]} // first three characters

---

template: aggregation

## More operators (continued)

Additional operations… and expressions, include:

--

- `$add`, `$subtract`, `$divide`, and `$multiply`, etc.

--

- e.g.

```javascript
{
  $subtract: ["$field1", "$field2"]; // i.e. field1 - field2
}
```

--

and [many more](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/), like `$toUpper`, `$trim`, `{$arrayElemAt: someArray, someIndex}`, etc.

--

- Note that in most cases, the values can be arbitrary expressions that are: values at fields (e.g. `"$fieldName"`), a hardcoded value (e.g. `5`) or even the result of another operation (e.g. `{ $op: [arg1, arg2] }`)

---

template: aggregation

## $group

The `$group` operator creates distinct groups as separate documents.

--

- similar to `GROUP BY` in SQL

--

```javascript
// counts the number of documents per Agency
{$group: {
  _id: "$Agency",
  listingCount: {$sum: 1}
}}
```

--

- The `_id` value is the field to group by, prefixed with a dollar sign `$`, and surrounded by quotes.

--

- the second field is given a value that is the aggregate operation to perform on each group.

--

- there is a [long list of aggregate operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/#accumulators-group), similar to those in SQL, including `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$stdDevSamp`, and more.

# Pipeline Examples

template: pipeline-examples

## Match only

Filter such that the minimum `Salary Range From` in our results is $200,000:

```javascript
let min_from = { $match: { "Salary Range From": { $gt: 200000 } } };

db.jobs.aggregate([min_from]);
```

--

- A one-stage filter like this could easily have been done using just `db.collection.find()`, without a pipeline.

---

template: pipeline-examples

## Match and project

For all positions that are paid annually (see `Salary Frequency`), show the top `10` positions that have the largest range of possible salaries.

```javascript
let salaryGap = { $subtract: ["$Salary Range To", "$Salary Range From"] };

let fields = {
  $project: {
    _id: 0,
    "Business Title": 1,
    "Salary Gap": salaryGap,
  },
};

let annualExternal = {
  $match: {
    "Salary Frequency": "Annual",
    "Posting Type": "External",
  },
};

let sortGapDesc = { $sort: { "Salary Gap": -1 } };

db.jobs.aggregate([annualExternal, fields, sortGapDesc, { $limit: 10 }]);
```

---

template: pipeline-examples

## Match, project, and match

Same as previous example, but only show the positions where the salary range is lower than $5,000, but not $0.

```javascript
let salaryGap = { $subtract: ["$Salary Range To", "$Salary Range From"] };

let fields = {
  $project: {
    _id: 0,
    "Business Title": 1,
    "Salary Gap": salaryGap,
  },
};

let annualExternal = {
  $match: {
    "Salary Frequency": "Annual",
    "Posting Type": "External",
  },
};

let maxDiff = { $match: { "Salary Gap": { $lt: 5000, $gt: 0 } } };

db.jobs.aggregate([annualExternal, fields, maxDiff]);
```

## Group

Let's calculate the average each city agency pays for the low end of the salary range for Career Level "`Entry-Level`", without including agencies with an average lower than $30,000.

```javascript
let matchEntryLevel = { $match: { "Career Level": "Entry-Level" } };

let avgSalaryAgencyGroup = {
  $group: {
    _id: "$Agency",
    avgSalaryFrom: { $avg: "$Salary Range From" },
  },
};

let match30K = {
  $match: {
    avgSalaryFrom: { $gte: 30000 },
  },
};

db.jobs.aggregate([matchEntryLevel, avgSalaryAgencyGroup, match30K]);
```

---

template: pipeline-examples

## Group

Let's see how many jobs were posted for every year

```javascript
let extractYear = { $arrayElemAt: [{ $split: ["$Posting Date", "/"] }, -1] };

let fields = { $project: { year: extractYear } };

let countByYear = { $group: { _id: "$year", count: { $sum: 1 } } };

let orderByYear = { $sort: { _id: -1 } };

db.jobs.aggregate([fields, countByYear, orderByYear]);
