marginal density funct
discrete rand var:

marginal pmf obtained by 
summing over rows or over columns

equivalent for continuous rand var
marginal probability density funct

f_X(a) = int_{-inf}^{inf} f_{X, Y}(a, y) dy
f_Y(b) =  int_{-inf}^{inf} f_{X, Y}(x, b) dx

marginal distri funct
F_{x}(u) = int_{-inf}^{u} f_X (a) du
= int_{-inf}^{u} (int_{-inf}^{inf} f_{X, Y}(a, y) dy) du

F_{y}(v) = int_{-inf}^{v} f_Y (b) db
=  int_{-inf}^{v} (int_{-inf}^{inf} f_{X, Y}(x, b) dx) db

from joint distri to joint prob density funct

know F_X(a), calculate f_x(a)
f_X(a) = d/da[F_X(a)]

know F_{X, Y}(a), calculate f_{x, y}(a)
f_{X, Y}(a, b) 
= partial / partial a 
  partial / partial b
  [F_{X, Y}(a, b)]	 

expected val
disc rand var
X in {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}
Y in {b_1, b_2, ..., b_n}

E[g(X, Y)] 
= sum_{a_i} sum_{b_j} g(a_i, b_j) p_{X, Y}(a_i, b_j)
//  p_{X, Y}(a_i, b_j) is joint pmf

continuous rand var

E[g(X, Y)] 
= int_{-inf}^{inf} int_{-inf}^{inf} g(x, y) f_{X, Y}(x, y) dx dy
// f_{X, Y}(x, y) is joint pdf


X: value of x-coordinate point
Y: value of y-coordinate point
uniform distri funct
f_{X, Y} =
{
	1 	if x in [0, 1], y in [0, 1]
	0	else
}

volume of unit cube = 1
f_{X, Y}(x, y) is height, so it is 1
int f_{X, Y}(x, y) dA = 1


E[aX + bY + c] = aE[X] + bE[Y] + c

E[X^2] = int_{-inf}^{inf} x^2 f_X(x) dx
int_{-inf}^{inf} int_{-inf}^{inf} x^2 f_{X, Y}(x, y) dy dx

covariance
var(x + y) = e[((x + y) - e[x + y])^2]
= e[(x + y)^2 - 2e[x + y](x + y) + (e[x + y])^2] 
= e[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2e[x]x - 2e[x]y 
- 2e[y]x - 2e[y]y + + e[x]^2 + e[x]e[y] + (e[y])^2]
= ...
= var(x) + var(y) + 2e[(x - e[x])(y - e[y])]

cov(x, y) = e[(x - e[x])(y - e[y])
