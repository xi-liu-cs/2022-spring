uncorrelated not imply indep

worksheet 6
case cov(x, y) = 0
x & y are not indep



x\y	-1 	2 
0	1/6	0	1/6
1	1/6 	1/2	2/3
2	1/6	0 	1/6
	1/2	1/2

x & y not indep
p_x p_y != p_{x,y}

e[x] = 1
e[y] = 1/2
e[xy] = sum_i sum_j a_i b_j p_{X, Y}(a_i, b_j)
= 1/2

cov(x, y) = e[xy] - e[x]e[y] = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0
x & y not indep, but they are uncorrelated



covariance & change of units
define T = aX + b
V = cY + d

cov(T, V) = ac cov(x, y)
only the scaling affect
shift do not affect 


indep of unit
correlation coefficient


rho(x, y)
= cov(x, y) / sqrt{var(x) var(y)}

units cancel for the for numerator and denominator

var(x) = 0
means it is not a rand var
a certain event, always happen

if var(x) = 0 or var(y) = 0
rho(x, y) = 0


perfect correlation 
Y = aX
when correlation coefficient = 1
plot of X vs Y is a straight line


more correlation coefficient
= more tight of the points to the least squares fit line



emergency room at a hospital
like a model of times 
of arrival of successive patients
expected number of patients in 
any time window

1. number of arrivals
1) key hypotheses

a. number of arrivals in
2 distinct nonoverlapping time
intervals are indep rand var

b. rate of arrival is 
constant over time
(in an averaged sense)
rate of arrival = lamda

2) number of arrivals

interval of interest [0, t]

split the time interval 
into subintervals 
small enough that the number 
of arrivals in each subinterval 
if the interval is small enough (ex: 1 micro second)
then the number of interval is either 0 or 1
(since there is a line, not allow to step on 
another person's shoulder)

in each subinterval of t / n
i have a bernoulli rand var with parameter p

e[x_{bernoulli}] = p 
= (rate of arrival)(length of time interval)
= (lamda)(t / n)

n_t = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n

p_n_t(k) = binom(n, k) (lamda t / n)^k (1 - lamda t / n)^{n - k}
