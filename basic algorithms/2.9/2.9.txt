T(n) = Theta(n lg n)


T(2) = 2T(1) + 2 = 4

base case n = 2:
T(2) <= c (2) (log_2 2)
4 <= c (2) (1)
2 <= c

space complexity sc of merge:
Theta(m + k)

quick sort
in place
1. choose a pivot (choose it the last element A[n])
2. partition the array into 2 parts
based on the pivot
left elements <= pivot < right elements
3. recursively sort left & right parts
