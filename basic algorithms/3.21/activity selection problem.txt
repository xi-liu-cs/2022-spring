activity a_i has 
start time s_i
finish time f_i

activity a_i in
time interval [s_i, f_i)

activity a_i and a_j are
compatible if 
[s_i, f_i) and [s_j, f_j)
do not overlap

compatible if s_i >= f_j
or s_j >= f_i

S_{ij} = set of activities that start
after a_i finishes and finish before
activity a_j starts
