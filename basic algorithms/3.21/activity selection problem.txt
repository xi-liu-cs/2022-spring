activity a_i has 
start time s_i
finish time f_i

activity a_i in
time interval [s_i, f_i)

activity a_i and a_j are
compatible if 
[s_i, f_i) and [s_j, f_j)
do not overlap

compatible if s_i >= f_j
or s_j >= f_i

S_{ij} = set of activities that start
after a_i finishes and finish before
activity a_j starts
 
find a max set of mutually compatible 
activities in S_{ij}

max set is A_{ij}
includes some activity a_k

including a_k in an optimal solution
left with 2 subproblems:

1. set S_{ik} has activities that start
after activity a_i finishes and 
finish before activity a_k starts

2. set S_{kj} has activities that start
after activity a_k finishes and 
finish before activity a_j starts

A_{ik} = A_{ij} cap S_{ik}
A_{kj} = A_{ij} cap S_{kj}
