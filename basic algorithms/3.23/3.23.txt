proof correctness: greedy
lemma
at each iteration, taking the interval
with min finishing point among 
the remaining intervals (that do not
intersect the previously chosen interval)
gives an optimal non-overlapping subset of intervals


geometry
find convex hull
definition
convexity: a set in the plane is 
called convex if for any 2 points
in the set, the whole line segment
connecting these 2 points also fully
lies in the set

convex hull: convex hull of n given
points in the plane is the smallest convex
set containing all the n points


fact
any 3 consecutive points on the boundary
of the convex hull in the counter-clockwise
order must form a counter-clockwise direction


problem 

input: n given points in the plane
(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)

output: find the convex hull of n given
points: output the points on the boundary
of the convex hull in the counter-clockwise order



graham's scan
(1) find the initial point on the convex hull:
extreme corner points
the point with min x-coordinate among 
all the given points (leftmost point)
if there is a tie
choose the bottom point among
the leftmost point

(2) sort out the rest of the points
with respect to the angle they form
with the vertical line emanated
downward from p_0
