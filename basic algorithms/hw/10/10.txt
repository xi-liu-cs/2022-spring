tree = connected acyclic graph
spanning tree = contain all vertices
spanning tree of graph g 
= subset of edges of g
that form a tree 
& hit all vertices of g

mst: given graph g = (v, e)
& edge weights w: E -> R
find a spanning tree T of 
minimum weigt total weight

cut (s, v-s) of an undirected
graph g = (v, e) is a partition 
of v

light edge:
weight is minimum of any edge 
crossing the cut

topo sort: 
decreasing order of finishing time
vertices at the front have latest finish time
since finish time of v is defined when all
of the adjacent vertices of v are finished
