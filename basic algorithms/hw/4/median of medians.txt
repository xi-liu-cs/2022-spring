properties of pivot

pivot = median of medians

of n/5 groups
half the number of groups 
(1/2)(n/5) = n/10 groups have their median less than the pivot	(left part)
(1/2)(n/5) = n/10 groups have their median greater than the pivot	(right part)

in each of the n/10 groups with median
less than the pivot,
there are 2 elements that are smaller than
their respective medians

each of the n/10 groups from (left part)
have at least 3 elements that are smaller than the pivot
/* 2 elements that are less than local median + the local median 
that is less than the global median */

similarly,
each of the n/10 groups from (right part)
have at least 3 elements that are greater than the pivot
/* 2 elements that are greater than local median + the local median 
that is greater than the global median */

so
pivot is less than 3(n/10) elements 
and greater than another 3(n/10) elements

T(n) <= T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + cn
T(n/5): find the median of n/5 medians,
by running quickselect on them
O(n): find the median in each of the n/5 groups
T(7n/10): quickselect recursion
