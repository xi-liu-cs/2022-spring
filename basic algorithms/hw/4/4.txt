(a)

after choosing a pivot in the select() function

array:
1	k	n

A[1...k] <= A[k]
A[k] -> kth smallest


in select()
if i == k
	return rand_i
//return the index of pivot instead of its value


use a for loop to store A[1...k] in an array
not asked to sort 
and output that array









4
(b)
L to k smallest elements
which are k - L + 1 elements

use the algo developed 
in part (a)

first find the 1 to k smallest elements in 
array of length n

then call the algo 
to find L
