Hi,
my algorithm is correct, and there should not be any point deduction, can you regrade?
the algorithm is greedy as demonstrated in my explanation. 
for the 4 input arrays that you provided, my function correctly returns true
for them since for all of the test cases, the frog can start
from the last index and jump to the first index of the array 
a = {1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1}, a2 = {1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2}, 
a3 = {1, 0, 1, 3, 3}, a4 = {1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 4}

output of my function:
a: can_reach = 1
a2 = can_reach = 1
a3 = can_reach = 1
a4 = can_reach = 1
