von neumann architecture:
main mem
cpu
processor or core
interconnection 互连
是指使用连接器件把一端的电缆或光缆与另一端的光缆
between mem & cpu
every location has
1. address (to access the location)
2. location's contents (instruction or data stored)

42
cpu is logically divided into 
1. control unit 控制单元, responsible 
for deciding which instructions in prog executed
2. data path 数据通路
executing actual instructions

fetch or read: mem -> cpu

written to mem: cpu -> mem

each process runs for a 
small interval of time (time slice, 时间片
a short interval of time during which
a computer or its central processor
deals uninterruptedly with one user or program,
before switching to another)

block: if a process needs to wait for a resource
(ex: needs to read data from external storage)
it will block
stop executing and the operating system
can run another process

threading provides a mechanism for programmers
to divide their programs into more or less independent tasks,
with the property that when one thread is blocked, 
another thread can be run

in most systems, 
possible to switch between threads much faster
than it is possible to switch between processes

threads are "lighter weight" than processes
threads are contained within processes
so threads can use the same executable
share the same memory and I/O devices

two threads belonging to one process can 
share most of the process's resources

when a thread is started, it forks off the process
when a thread terminates, it joins the process

caching:
compnay has factory (cpu) in 1 town
and a warehouse 仓库 (main mem) in another town
single, two-lane road joining the factory and the warehouse

virtual mem developed so main mem
can function as a cache for secondary storage

idle parts can be kept in a block of secondary storage:
swap space

trouble if assign physical mem addresses to pages

page table can double the time needed to
access a location in main memory

many programs want to use same block 
of mem

to avoid this problem:
when prog compiled
pages are assigned virtual page numbers

when prog run
table created that maps virtual page numbers
to physical addresses

when prog refers to a virtual address
page table is used to translate the 
virtual address into a physical address

ensure that the memory used by one program 
doesn't overlap the memory used by another

drawback of page table:
double time needed to access a location 
in main mem

virtual page number is stored as a
part of the virtual address

each byte in the page can be 
identified with 12 bits, since 2^12 = 4096

can use the low-order 12 bits of the virtual address
to locate a byte within a page

virtual page number can be computed 
from the virtual address without going to memory

translation-lookaside buffer caches 
a small number of entries (typically 16–512)
from the page table in very fast memory


51
if access a page not in mem,
attempted access is a page fault

instruction level parallelism 指令级并行
is the parallel or simultaneous execution of
a sequence of instructions in a computer prog


ILP must not be confused with concurrency.
In ILP there is a single specific thread of 
execution of a process. 
On the other hand, 
concurrency involves the assignment 
of multiple threads to a CPU's core 
in a strict alternation, or in true parallelism 
if there are enough CPU cores, 
ideally one core for each runnable thread


A superscalar 超标量 processor is a CPU that 
implements a form of parallelism 
called instruction-level parallelism 
within a single processor



Instruction-level parallelism, or ILP,
attempts to improve processor performance 
by having multiple processor components
or functional units simultaneously
executing instructions
1. pipelining 指令流水线
	functional units are arranged in stages
	dividing incoming instructions 
	into a series of sequential steps ("pipeline")
2. multiple issue 多发技术
	mutiple instructions can be 
	simultaneously initiated
	

pipeline:
factory assembly line 装配线; (工厂的)流水线
add floating point 
chassis 机壳, 机架, base frame of a motor vehicle
