atomic 
critical
locks

everything before
#pragma omp parallel
is shared

everything inside {}
is local

implicit barrier
in #for, if no nowait, wait for 
other processes to reach

if not specified
create num threads
= min(# logical cores,
# iterations)

static variables
are stored in data part
when a function called
again
old static var is still there

int x
#pragma omp parallel
{

}

x is shared

float is too slow

openmp2
p21
factor is positive or negative

default(none)
more readability
