--Purpose of OS: provide services to user-level programs

--Definition: An operating system creates, for processes, a machine
    that is easier to program than the raw hardware would be.



os is a software that does
1. manage resources of the machine
scheduling -- give every process some cpu
virtual memo -- give every some physical memo

resource management means one bad program does
not ruin another, os does
	--multiplexing(simultaneous transmission)
	--isolation, protection
	--sharing

2. abstracting hardware
hide details of hardware (os gets dirty)
repeated code
unclear how to run > 1 application at once


--one of our labs will be a miniOS that boots on real hardware
 --labs could/should actually be fun
--Regardless, you need to allocate time
