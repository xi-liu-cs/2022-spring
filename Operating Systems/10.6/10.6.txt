x-rays deeper, destroy tumor
1. eletrons or photons
field light mode


			beam energy   beam current  beam modifier
electron therapy		5-25MeV	       low                   scanning magnet
x-ray, photon mode 	25MeV	       high		flattener
field light mode		0	       none		mirror/none

row 1 and row 2 with mirror/none beam modifier
row 2 with scanning magnet beam modifier

what can do wrong?
1. operator typed too fast
2. reuse code from old machine
3. train operator to ignore
4. lack of procedure to respond to procedures
5. find some mistake and fix it
	10^-9 probabilities number
6. when machine detect issue, let people continue, in wrong mode
7. no clear explanation of malfunction 54 message //10
8. software dont have audit trial
9. doctor's order does not match with operator's order

only indication of problem is patient injury

implement a interlock in hardware, when modes do not match

therac-25
cheaper, get rid of a component

is the program invariant maintained?



their pseudo code get extra stuff
issue is high current not high energy

1/1000 chance machine leads to gruesome death


inverse correlation of programmer's quality
google:
better programmer (better pay), 
little consequence when error

linear accelerator company:
worse programmer, 
big consequence when error
