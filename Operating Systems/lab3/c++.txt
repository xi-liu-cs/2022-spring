The difference (which is neither minor nor a matter of style)
is that stdio.h and other C-like libraries when imported in a C++
file may pollute the global namespace,
while the corresponding C++ headers (cstdio, cstdlib, cassert)
place the corresponding functions, variables, etc., in the std namespace.
It's strongly advised to use the latter in C++
