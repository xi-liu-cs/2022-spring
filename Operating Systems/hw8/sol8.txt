1.1

3 entries. The page size is 4096, so map1 consumes 2 entries, and map2
consumes one entry.

1.2

2 pages. The 3 virtual pages map to two physical pages in the OS buffer
cache.


2. 

Lay out the allocated memory so that the last legitimately allocated
byte is on the last byte of the allocated page (this "wastes" the first
part of a page).  Mark the next virtual page (past the array) as "not in
use" (this does not cost physical memory), aka PTE_P=0. At that point,
memory references past the end of the array will generate page faults.
