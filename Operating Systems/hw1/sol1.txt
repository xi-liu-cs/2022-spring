HW1 Solutions

1.  
    a = 1, b = 1, c = 2, d = 1

    (Note that op1 modifies only the *local* copies of a,b.)

2.
    COMMENT1: a[0] = 0, a[1] = 10, a[2] = 100, a[3] = UNKOWN, a[4] = UNKOWN
    COMMENT2: a[0] = 0, a[1] = 10, a[2] = 100, a[3] = 2, a[4] = 100 



3. 
   (1) Prevent user level processes from manipulating hardware
   (2) Program will have good portability across machines
   (3) Processes do not have to have redundant code
