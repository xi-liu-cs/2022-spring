hard disk drive
1. i/o
2. foundation of file sys

platter 盘片
spindle 主轴
stack of magnetic platters
60 - 250 rot/sec

innovation inside ipod (listen music)
cheap & lightweight hard drive

now solid state drive

cheapest dollars/gigabyte beside tape

cold data (not care about lookup time)

tape does not have random access
has to read whole thing

amazon, google buy a lot of hard disk drive

reliability: 
bits delay over time
least to highest reliability:
solid state drive < hdd < tape

seek time is slow


track 磁道: circle on a platter
sector: chunk of a track (4KB)

seek 4 phases:
speedup (accelerate), coast (fix velocity), slowdown, settle

avg seek time
= time to seek 1/3 of the disk
manufactures report
1/3 of the whole disk

amortized
beneficial seek
from 0 (center) to 1 (rim)
 
paying overhead

terabyte TB
10^12 byte < 10^40 byte
hardware manufacture use left unit (trillion),
so a bigger number of TB



Mean time between failures: million hours



disk 
= linear array of sectors

ZONING
more sectors in outer track

SKEWING

SPARING
certain sector fail, remap



when write,
if wrong location of seek, destroy data

longer to settle when write vs read
so write slow






spindle speed 12000 rpm
avg seek time 12ms
transfer rate 128mb/s
sector 512byte

a)
throughput if 500 sectors read randomly in fifo

b)
same question but reads sequential, faster
(500 contiguous data)





a)

each rotation = 12000 rpm = 200 rps
200 rps = 200 rotations / 1 second
1 rotation takes 1 second / 200 = 0.005 second = 5(0.001)second
= 5ms
rotation 5 ms
rotational delay is half a rotation

1s/128 mb * 512B = 2^9 / 2^27 = 2^-18  
throughput = tot byte / time
500 * 512 / (500 (rotational delay + seek + transfer))
= 500 * 512 / (500 (1/2(2.5ms + 12ms + 4 mu s))
= 512 * 70B / 1s



paying seek time every read
transfer rate 128mb/s is best 





b)
500 * 512 / (2.5ms + 12ms + 1s /(128mb) 500(512) )
= 2^18 bytes * 60 / 1000 ms = 16mb/s
