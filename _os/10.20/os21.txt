we have been assuming that 
every address space of every process fits into memory
now relax these assumptions

memory hierarchy

need to stash away portions of address spaces
that currently are not in great demand:
use hard disk drive


2
swap space 交换分区
a space on a hard disk that is a substitute for physical memory

swap pages out of memory to it
and swap pages into memory from it

4 page physical memory
8 page swap space

memory reference:
process generates virtual memory references
(instruction fetches, data accesses)
hardware translates them into physical addresses

1. extracts vpn from virtual address
2. checks the TLB for a match 
3.a. if a hit, produce the resulting physical address & fetch from memory
3.b.
