操作系统中颠簸(thrashing)解决办法


What is thrashing?
Processes require more memory than system has

definition of working set (short version): the pages a
process has touched over some trailing window of time

void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
int fd, off_t offset)
mmap creates a new mapping in the virtual address
space of the calling process
addr = starting address for the new mapping
length = length of mapping

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/mmap.htm

mmap() function asks to map length bytes 
starting at offset offset from the file (or other object)
specified by the file descriptor fd into memory,
preferably at address start

<<proc, vpn> entry>
if call a mmap, 
dont want all of the files show up in mem
