by calling mmap() on an already
opened file descriptor, 
a process is returned 
a pointer to the beginning
of a region of virtual memory
where the contents of the file
seem to be located

This notion of mapping a set of contiguous
virtual pages to an arbitrary
location in an arbitrary file 
is known as memory mapping
mmap allows application 
programs to do their own memory mapping

csapp
*875
#include <unistd.h> //os api
#include <sys/mman.h> //mem map files

void *mmap(void *start,
size_t length,
int prot,
int flags, 
int fd,
off_t offset);

returns: pointer to mapped area if OK,
MAP_FAILED (-1) on error


The mmap function asks the kernel
to create a new virtual memory area,
preferably one that starts at address start,
and to map a contiguous chunk of the
object specified by the file descriptor fd
to the new area
