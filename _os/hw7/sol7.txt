1.
- The kernel's code and data has physical address range 0x40000--0x58000
- The physical address of the kernel's stack is 0x7f000.
- The virtual addresses are the same as the physical addresses, because
for this range of the virtual address space, the kernel's page table
uses the identity mapping.
- PAGENUMBER(MEMSIZE_PHYSICAL)

2a. 7 pages, computed as 3 data pages plus 4 pages of metadata.

2b. 2^9 + 6 (=518): computed as 5 pages of metadata (one L1 page table, one L2
page table, one L3 page table, one L4 page table with 2^9 entries full,
and one more L4 page table) + 2^9 + 1 data pages.

2c. 2^18 + 2^9 + 6: Each L3 page table points indirectly to 2^18
last-level page entries (each L3 page table has 2^9 entries, each of
which points to an L4 page table with 2^9 entries). Thus, the question
requires two L3 page tables. The first L3 page table points to 2^9 L4
page tables; the second points to one L4 page table, for a total of 2^9
+ 1 L4 page tables. Thus, the total is: 1+1+2+2^9+1 for the page
structures (aka metadata) plus 2^18 + 1 for the pages themselves.

3.1. Sometimes. If the page is not present, then a TLB miss and a
    page fault will happen at the same time. If the page is not writable
    but it is in the TLB, then a store to memory can cause a page fault but
    no TLB miss. (And if the page is present and the permissions are
    consistent with the requested operation, yet the VA,PA mapping is
    not in the TLB, then there will be a TLB miss but no page fault.)

3.2. Sometimes. If the page is not present, or the permission check
fails, then there will be a page fault on top of the TLB miss.

3.3. Sometimes. Similar answer to above. 

3.4. Always. PTE_P | PTE_U means user readable.

3.5. Sometimes. If PTE_W is set, then it is permissible, otherwise not.
