10/15 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10/18
resubmit again in 10/18 (used 3 slack days)
because 
in buyManyItems in EStore.cpp
1. need to sort 
2. 
    if(buyable)
    {//buy everything
        for(long unsigned int i = 0; i < item_ids->size(); i++)
        {
            Item * item_p = inventory + item_ids->at(i);
            item_p->valid = false; //this line should be removed
            item_p->quantity--;
        }
    }
above errors can take 10 points off
