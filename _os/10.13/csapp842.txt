virtual memory is organized as an array of 
N contiguous byte-size cells stored on disk
contents of the array on disk are cached
in main memory

data on disk is partitioned into blocks that
serve as the transfer units between the 
disk and the main memory

virtual pages = fixed-size blocks
virtual memory is partitioned into VIRTUAL PAGES
physical memory is partitioned into PHYSICAL PAGES


843
SRAM(静态随机存取存储器) cache to denote the L1, L2, and L3 cache memories between the
CPU and main memory, 
DRAM(动态随机存取存储器) cache to denote the VM system's
cache that caches virtual pages in main memory


844
page table is an array of page table entries (PTE)
Each page in the virtual address space has a PTE at
a fixed offset in the page table


845
a DRAM cache miss is known as a page fault
