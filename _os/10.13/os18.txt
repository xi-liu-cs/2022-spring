chop up space into fixed-sized pieces: paging

physical memory =
array of fixed-sized slots called page frames 页帧

3
this page table is a per-process
data structure

movl <virtual address>, %eax

split virtual address into
1. virtual page number (VPN)
2. offset (within the page)


4
when process generates a virtual address,
os & hardware must combine to translate it
into a meaningful physical address

movl 21, %eax

010101 //2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21
